================
4.0.0 2019-03-19
================

Changed
-------
- **BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE:** Protocol has changed, including the names of
  Channels workers.
- **BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE:** Observe changes in the queryset model only (by
  default). Other tables can be tracked by explicitly listing the dependencies
  in @observable decorator.
- **BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE:** Ensure observers exist when subscribing. Subscribe
  (and observer creation) was separated from the evaluation step. Subscribe
  includes subscriber and observer creation if needed, and executes in single
  query. Observer instances are not removed from database anymore. Observers
  without subscribers are skipped to optimize performance. Observers and
  subscribers can be deleted using ``clearobservers`` Django command.
- **BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE:** Overhaul Python source distribution (sdist)
- Support PostgreSQL 10

Added
-----
- Observers with the same ID are throttled. The default throttle rate is 2
  seconds.
